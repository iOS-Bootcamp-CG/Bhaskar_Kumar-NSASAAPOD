## Feedback

1. Show an activity loader when API is getting called in BG
2. The main screen UI formatting needs to change. You should be showing Title
3. Load image from DB and not from URL. You should be storing base64 in DB for image
4. The main thread is block when image is being loaded. Put the operation in BG


Stretched Goals
1. Make UI responsive in Landscape mode
